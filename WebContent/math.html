    Division by zero is prohibited. This is mathematically impossible, since multiplying any number by 0 gives 0 as a result. Let's try to divide the number 4 by 0. We get a certain value x. 4 / 0 = x. Solving this equation, we get that x * 0 = 4, but we know that any number multiplied by 0 should give 0 as a result. So division by 0 is impossible
